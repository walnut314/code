Systems software/architecture development: drivers and firmware, also
higher-level user mode applications.

EMPLOYMENT EXPERIENCE

Helitrak, Inc, Software Engr                            Dec 2015 to Present
    Helicopter autopilot embedded ARM firmware, device drivers, inertial 
    sensors, servo control/calibration, flight test instrumentation and 
    post-flight video/audio processing using OpenCV and DirectX. Ported
    control law algorithms from Matlab/Simulink.
    Developed embedded ARM firmware, device drivers/HAL, bus bridges and 
    interfaces [I2C/SPI/RS485/CAN], inertial sensor interfaces/IMU, servo 
    control/PID algorithms, flight test instrumentation and post-flight 
    video/audio/data processing.    

OSNexus, Inc, Software Engr                             Jul 2015 to Dec 2015
    Software defined cloud-storage - Linux kernel device driver development, 
    developed SCST/FC & iSCSI load-balance path and high-availability node 
    failover code, and developed mapper-based driver to evaluate perf of 
    CEPH/RBDs and crush map zone distribution.

Western Digital, Sr. Principal SDE, Lead                Sept 2012 to Jul 2015
    Developed Linux kernel framework for plugging multiple storage transports: 
    NVMe, AHCI/SATAe, SOP/PQI for FPGA and ASIC bring-up, device and firmware 
    virtualization. Framework allowed kernel execution of compiled scripts. 
    Also, developed device mapper layer for SATAe hybrid SSD/HDD drive.

Microsoft, Software Engr                                Nov 2003 to Sept 2012
    Developed and debugged 3rd party storage and file system drivers.  Models 
    used were Storport/Scsiport miniports, full port drivers, various storage 
    filter drivers based off of WDM or KMDF, 3rd party volume managers, full 
    file system drivers, file system mini-filters based off of Filter Manager, 
    network redirectors, and network Lightweight Filters.  Debugged many internal 
    OS components, filed bugs, and in many cases provided fixes.  Developed various 
    code samples for external publication on OneCode.

PolyServe, Sr. Software Engr                            Aug 2002 to Nov 2003
    Developed Win2K and Linux disk and partition device drivers to provide
    cluster-wide control of the SAN storage IO subsystem.   Also developed
    Win2K/Linux cross-platform user space components for SAN storage control. 
    Developed Win2K vendor specific DSM drivers managing multiple paths on 
    storage arrays.

Veritas, Staff Software Engr                            Nov 2000 to Aug 2002
    Developed Win2K SCSI/FC dynamic multi-path driver with MSCS/VCS clustering 
    support for VM product, user-mode provider interface to Java client, 
    satellite drivers for 3rd party array controllers: EMC, IBM, NEC, Hitachi, 
    Compaq, and JBODs.

NEC Systems, Principal Software Engr                    Nov 1997 to Nov 2000
    Developed driver to stress and test OHCI 1394 hardware/firmware.

Cirrus Logic Visual Media, Software Engr                Aug 1996 to Nov 1997
    Developed mini-VDD for 546x Laguna chipset.

SpaceLabs Medical, Software Engr                        Aug 1995 to Aug 1996
    Developed embedded VxWorks/68332-based gas analyzer.

Boeing Commercial Avionics, Software Engr               Aug 1992 to Aug 1995
    Developed Arinc629 bus controller ASIC firmware for 777.

Hughes Aircraft Electro-Optics, Systems Engr            Jan 1987 to Aug 1992
    Developed algorithms and VME/680x0-based RTOS exec for scanning IR sensors.
