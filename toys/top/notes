DFS
    connected components undirected graph
    floodfill label individual components in forest
    articulation points and bridges
    strongly connected - tarjan - directed graph
    topological sort in DAG

MST
    Kruskal - Greedy

BFS
    SSSP - unweighted undirected graph

Dijkstra - Greedy
    SSSP - weighted undirected graph

Bellman-Ford - DP
    SSSP - negative weights directed graph
    Negative Cycle Check

Floyd-Warshall - DP (small directed (+/-) weighted graph)
    APSP - all pairs shortest path
    Transitive closure - check if any 2 verts are directly OR indirectly connected
