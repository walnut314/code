Dear IRS agent:
I received a similar CP2000 for the tax year 2019, and that notice was resolved as 
"no deficiency".

The CP2000 I just received is for the same "reason" just different year (tax year 2020).

The Problem (which is my fault):
===============================
The 1099 was issued to me personally (Bart Anthony Bartel).  It should have been issued to 
the trust BART ANTHONY BARTEL TRUST (EIN: 80-6233254)
This error occurred in 2019 and 2020.

I did pay the taxes for the 1099 for tax years 2019 and 2020, filed with the trust, but it showed
up in the IRS system as unpaid by me individually.

I am enclosing the "Decision" for the CP2000 for tax year 1019.  The reason for the notice
is the same in this instance (tax year 2020) as it was for 2019.

I hope my explanation makes sense.

Sincerely,


Bart Anthony Bartel
