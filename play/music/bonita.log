Intro: C#m B C#m

C#m         B        C#m
Last night I dreamt of San Pedro

A     C#m      E          B
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song

C#m           B            C#m
A young girl with eyes like the desert

A  C#m            E         B
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

C#m         G#m             F#m          E
Tropical the island breeze, All of nature, wild and free

B             F#m           C#m 
This is where I long to be  La isla bonita

G#m                         F#m       E
And when the samba played   The sun would set so high

B           F#m
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

G#m     F#m  C#m
Your Spanish lullaby

 
Chorus 

F#m      D       E        F#m
I want to be where the sun warms the sky

F#m                 D       E
When it's time for siesta   You can watch them go by

F#m       D      E           F#m
Beautiful faces, no cares in this world

         F#m         D         E  Cdim       C#m
Where a girl loves a boy    And a boy loves a girl
