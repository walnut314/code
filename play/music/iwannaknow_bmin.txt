Sound: Rock organ

Intro: B- A D G B-

B-              A     D              G                    B-
I gotta take a little time, A little time to think things over

         B-      A        D                G                B-
I better read between the lines, In case I need it when I'm older

         B-       A      D                   G             B-
Now this mountain I must climb, Feels like a world upon my shoulders

            B-       A        D                  G                  B-
Through the clouds I see love shine, It keeps me warm as life grows colder

      E-                A             E-                          A       E-
In my life there's been heartache and pain, I don't know if I can face it again

                     A           E-      G      D    E-     G
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far, To change this lonely life


        D         B-   A     E-          B-   A
I wanna know what love is, I want you to show me

        D         B-   A     E-           B-   A
I wanna feel what love is, I know you can show me
