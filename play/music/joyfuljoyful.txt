Op’ning to the sun above.

Center of unbroken praise.
G7          C       G7      C
Field and forest, vale and mountain,
G7      E7      Am    D7  G G7
Flow’ry meadow, flashing sea,

C                G7               C                  G7  C

Mortals, join the happy chorus,
C                   G7
Which the morning stars began;

Ever singing, march we onward,
G7      E7     Am    D7  G G7
Victors in the midst of strife,
C       F
Joyful music leads us Sunward
C               G7     C    
In the triumph song of life.
