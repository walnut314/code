D-              C     F              Bb                   D-
I gotta take a little time, A little time to think things over

         D-      C        F                Bb               D-
I better read between the lines, In case I need it when I'm older

         D-       C      F                   Bb            D-
Now this mountain I must climb, Feels like a world upon my shoulders

            D-       C        F                  Bb                 D-
Through the clouds I see love shine, It keeps me warm as life grows colder

      G-                C             G-                          C       G-
In my life there's been heartache and pain, I don't know if I can face it again

                     C           G-      Bb     F    G-     Bb
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far, To change this lonely life


        F         D-   C     G-          D-   C
I wanna know what love is, I want you to show me

        F         D-   C     G-           D-   C
I wanna feel what love is, I know you can show me
