[Verse 1]
		 C		   Csus	 C
I'm finding myself at a loss for words
	   C/F
And the funny thing is it's okay
			 C	   Csus	C
The last thing I need is to be heard
	  C/F				
But to hear what You would say

[Chorus 1]
		  C
Word of God speak
				    G
Would You pour down like rain
G	  F/A  Bb				F
Washing my  eyes to see Your majesty
			 C
To be still and know
				G
That You're in this place
G	    F/A   Bb	
Please let me  stay and rest
		F
In Your holiness
			
Word of God speak
