Colossians 3:23 - 4:1
Sermon: New Relationships: Be a good employee (worker bee) work <==> walk
    Story of RV trip - broke down waited 5 hrs
        God dealt with his attitude re:Les Schwab Sunday closed
        Lesson: When we're inconvenienced, do we still trust?

v.23: Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men
Work ethic:     
    1. What does it look like?
        heartily, industrious, can I put the stamp "Jesus" on my work
        complaining / not complaining - both are contagious
        Phil 2:14-15 don't grumble, wicked and perverse generation

    2. What does it produce? other than rice
        1. Integrity - Gal 1:10 For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? 
        Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would 
        not be a servant of Christ.
        2. Examples - 1 Tim 6:1 So that the name of God is not reviled - 
        3. Maturity - Eccl 2:22-23 perspective -> work is a vexation -> not to be worshipped
            We tend to invert the work/worship relationship: 
                work is our worship to God, work is not to be worshipped
        4. Perspective - Ps 127:1-2 unless the Lord builds the house <- actually a stress reducer

v24: knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving 
    the Lord Christ. 

    Transform your work to worship - God is watching and you will be rewarded
       Bema seat -> He will call to mind our work life
       there is no dichotomy: it is a working out of our walk
    
v25: For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality

    Don't be a wrongdoer - a crook - IRS - be a trusty advisor, truthteller
        Acts 10:34 anyone who fears God and does right is acceptable
        Lev 19:15 don't do injustice, love your neighbor as self

4:1 Masters, treat your bondservants justly and fairly, knowing that you also 
    have a Master in heaven.

    Counter to the ethics of Aristotle of Gaius -> mutual submission Eph 6:5-9
        Aristotle: Slaves were not totally incapable of thought, but they only needed minimal 
            amount of rational ability; just enough to understand and carry out their duties.            
        Gaius: someone subject to the dominion of another person contrary to nature.
            a bit more enlightened.

        List of things bosses hate: NMJ, NMM, WCT, PPP, ACD, CWS, TTM, SRM

    6. "Treat" => gr paracho => give us something useful!!!
    7. "Justly" => act per God's rqmts (morally) Micah 6:8 justice, kind, humble
    8. "Fairly" => equality, value/dignity => same as what we want for ourselves

    Final word about Masters: they should inspire employees through their example.  
    They should trust God and be patient.  Reflect Christ.
    
Words about Slaves: Paul/Jesus transformed this industry via mutual submission (Eph 5:21)

    Gal 3:28 "... neither Jew/Greek, Slave/Free, Male/Female
    Philemon 12-16 : Onesimus was to be treated as a brother.
    Mk 10:42-45 no lording over rather serve
    
    Eph 6:9
    "Masters, do the same to them, and stop your threatening, knowing that he who is both 
    their Masterc and yours is in heaven, and that there is no partiality with him.    

Story? DL Moody and European pastor's conference -> dirty shoes he cleaned.
