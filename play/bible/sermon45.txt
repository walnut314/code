1 Cor 10:1-13
Lessons from History
1944 allied invasion of France -> Normandy hedgerows
obstacle - fewer soldiers needed to defend the ground
in our battle we choose: a) out in the open, 2) behind hedgerow

Look back on Israel's history - learn from our mistakes
Edmund Burke - don't know history, rinse and repeat
1 Cor 9:27 self-control != disqualified
we can be like Joshua and Caleb

Heroes of the faith: -- see streams

1. (v1-5) God's deliverance (baptism) and provision (communion) for His people
don't be unaware of our ancestors
2 Tim 3:16-17 all scripture ... equipping/blessing

Paul uses family language: brothers, forefathers
God's people - continuity OT/NT: faith/promise/knowledge
don't be disobedient as forefathers

Church symbols: baptism & communion
a.) Baptism: forefathers delivered under the cloud - shade from sun
    protection and provision
Pharoah's army was blocked by the cloud
Passed through the sea Egypt (Hebrews) -> Israel nation
    birthed into Moses
Ex 19:(1) 4-6 Israel became His treasured possession
Jesus is our deliverer | Moses is a pre-type of Christ: Deut 18:15
Rom 6:3-4 baptised into His death.

b.) Communion - same spiritual food
daily manna - Jn 6:32-35 Jesus is the true bread
drink water from the rock Ex 17:2-6
40 yrs later - promised land - speak to the rock Num 20:10-12
    out of anger Moses struck the rock - in his own strength, disqualified
        usurped God's authority, pride, sinful independence
Why speak to the Rock? Jesus
    struck 1x crucified, speak = no need to re-crucify
OT - complained and rebelled -> overthrown
spies = 10 = no, 2 = go ==> fear Num 32:13
Heb 3:19 unbelief
Paul says LEARN!!!

2. (v6-11) Warning for Christians of OT Examples of failure
** Example => "type" liquid metal poured into a mold
4 types to avoid
a.) idolators: materialism Col 3:5 heart of covetousness
b.) sex immor.: Balaam and Balak and ass Num 25:1-3
    heart problem - Matt 5:27-28
    Job 31:1 eyes
c.) put Christ to test: Num 21:?? 
    Impatient with provision, talking smack, complain, dissatisfied
    Num 21:6-9 daring God to act
    are we dissatisfied? Phil 4:11-13 CONTENTMENT, I can do all things
d.) grumbling (Cora's rebellion): Num 16:2-3
    onomatopea gogguzo
    back to Egypt - fire and ground opening (angel destroyer)
    giving in to fears, no faith
We have the priviledge of looking back


3. (v12-13) God's faithfulness in our Temptations
Be careful - pridefulness and knowledge
don't let your guard down - hedgerows
Mk 14:29-31 ...I will not... (Peter)
Prov 16:18
Lead us not into temptation - humility and dependence
v13 God is faithful ... to provide an escape
NOT AFTER THE FALL - DURING IT!!!
2 Tim 2:??? He is faithful
we are not unique - common to man, not too strong, not beyond
Heb 4:15 .. as we are, yet ...
a way of escape -- exits
Jas 1:13 its our own evil desires, not God tempting us

Apps:
1. memorize scripture: 1 Cor 10:13 weapon
2. establish hedgerow - know the word Mt 5:29
    accountability
3. rely on His faithfulness
