Part 2a: (15 minutes)
---------------------

crazy mixed-up family - adopted by mom's adopted mom
adoption trial at 7
    Mom had mental health issues

I grew up in the Bob Newhart school of "just stop it!" and "stop it now!"
    no explanation - just figure it out

Father uninvolved - heavy handed - raised by mother, Dad was sad
    emotions were suppressed
    pain avoidance - or spanking avoidance
    coping skills -> food, later alcohol and drugs

Talk about being an active kid, skinny, lots of eating
Mom loved to cook

Lived my life like one big chemical reaction
or a pinball (all these metaphors yuk) so it was
natural to transition to my solution drugs and alcohol and always food



Part 2b: (15 minutes)
---------------------

Talk about spiritual recovery and steps
ODAT 
Accept responsibility - regardless of the past
I alone am accountable - always around others, but ...
I'm not alone - sponsor, meetings, God

1. step one was pretty easy for me
2. Excuse me? if you had my life, you'd eat too ...
3. its all about trust, who am I going to trust? 
    my nature is to control, not trust, but control is an illusion
4. stop blaming
5. I'm an isolator - when in doubt - isolate
