John 4 notes:

Shekem - historically significant location
Samaritans - half-breeds, dogs w/Assyrians, 2 Ki 17:24

Jn 4:1-6
    v4 "...had to pass..."? shortest path or other?

    Samaria - Jews considered them dogs, half-breeds

    Jesus was weary.. showing us His humanness - also disciples seemded okay to go 
    grocery shopping.

    Sixth hour - very hot

Jn 4:7-15
    Woman - alone at noon, outcast from Samaria, sexually promiscuous, lonely

    v7 Jesus asks for drink from her cup - unclean

    for us perhaps the Lord asks us stuff - and we question ourselves, 
    "you're asking me"?
    
    v10 asked for living (eternal) water - Jer 2:13 vs broken cisterns - 
    things we do to fill the gap

    v12 the woman is starting to get it.

    v13 Jesus was offering her a fulfillment she was trying to fill with men.  
    people are thirsty.

Jn 4:16-26
    v16 get hubby - offers partial confession vs. total honesty

    v17 Jesus doesn't slam her (word of knowledge) not condemning or condescending, 
    but affirming, tries to help her, His kindness led to her repentance

    v19 her response - you're a prophet? they only observed the Torah - 
    Moses was the last prophet.

    v20 was she deflecting? or perhaps truly broken and wanting to offer sacrifices 
    for atonement?

    v21 "of" the Jews, not "for" the Jews alone.

    v23 not a place. the Father seeks us, not us Him.  He pursues us!

    v26 the only person Jesus reveals his Messiah-ship - other than at His trial
    also, the 1st time gospel is preached outside the "lost sheep of Israel" 
    crumbs to dogs

Jn 4:27-30
    v28 she left her pot - she found living water

    v29 the men responded - perhaps concerned for their being revealed as a John

Jn 4:31-38
    v32 a teaching moment for disciples - "my food..doing His will" - 
    doing His will should energize out souls not drain us
    
    v35 sense of urgency

    v37 in Church converts most likely have been seeded long before coming - 
    by Mom's prayers

Jn 4:39-42
    v39 simple testimony - no need for Bible college, zero requirements 
    to share good news - come and see...
    there must have been a visible transformation in her
