Col 3:18-4:1 FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS

Story about report cards and eloping "it is with great regret ..."
    "Perspective is important in family life
    Perspective wrt to Paul's teaching in Roman times.

    Roman - patria protestus - father power - absolute authority life/slavery
    Paul's teaching was revolutionary for the times
    In our society we see the opposite - 
        revolutionary for different reason: fathers are portrayed as wimps / absentee

    The parent / child relationship is sacred

    The first mention of love in a relationship is between a father and son
    Gen 22:2 Abraham's son Isaac who he loves, offered as sacrifice - father / son
    picture of God the Father and Son

    ?THIS? is a template for father and son in the family context - URR???
        God is an example to fathers && Jesus is an example to children

Key: Just as our new identity in Christ reflects the image of God
    Our relationship reflects God's nature

God's design for family => 
    mutual submission per Eph 5:21 Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
    same in marriage as in parent and child

    instructions and expectations are given in this passage, parallel passage => Eph 6:1-4

1. God's instructions for children: "children obey your parents in everything
    for this pleases the Lord."

    This letter is being read in the church to the Colossians with expectation
    that children will hear what's being read --> NEED TIME MACHINE FOR MY KIDS

    the word "Child" assumes - still under parents roof, responsibility and
    therefore they must obey their parents
    
    The idea of honoring your parents extends to adult children - we are all
    someone's child

    The word "OBEY" : listen to a command, be obedient, used of the duty of a
    porter to answer the door to find out who it is. SO connection between hearing and doing.
    WHAT IS IT ABOUT "NO" THAT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

LIKE A FOOTBALL HUDDLE
    LISTEN for the PLAY and COUNT
    if under age, rel w/parents is most important relation
    besides with God.

    Parallel Eph 6:1 "children obey ... in the Lord ..."
    Acts 17:26 all nations from Abraham - exact times and places to be BORN
        God's fingerprint is on our lives
        and its no accident what parents we have

ALL parents have an inherent wisdom from God --> we can disagree yet obey: CAVEAT Acts 4:19

Col 3:20 Children, obey your parents in everything, FOR THIS PLEASES THE LORD.
Do what your parents ask -> is the best thing not to rebel
BE CAREFUL WITH PRIDEFUL REBELLIOUS HEART
    Prov 30:17 rebellion results in this.
    "The eye that mocks a father, that scorns an aged mother,
    will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley,
    will be eaten by the vulture."

Rebellious kids shows the social unravelling of the end-times:
2 Tim 3:1-2 ... disobedient to parents
BEING A FOLLOWER OF CHRIST SHOULD MAKE US BETTER KIDS AND CHRISTIANS
Lk 2:51 Jesus submitted to his earthly parents <-- after temple incident

Prov 10:1 Our obedience blesses our Parents
"A wise son brings joy to his father,
    but a foolish son brings grief to his mother."

Eph 6:1 children obey ... FOR THIS IS RIGHT
    honor your father and mother - 1st commandment with a promise
    Adult children are called to honor our parents == respect/value

Learn God's purpose for MY LIFE -> OBEY GOD, HONOR YOUR PARENTS, PAY TAXES
    WE CAN'T CHANGE A PERSON, WE CAN ONLY CHANGE OURSELVES

Taking care of your parents: even if it costs
Phil 2:14  Do everything without GRUMBLING or ARGUING -- good to memorize

God charges a blessing to those who obey -> quantity and quality

Question: what is God challenging us with? As an adult child?
