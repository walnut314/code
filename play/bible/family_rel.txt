Col 3:18-4:1 Family Relationships
Eric Van Lustbader -> Sunset Warrior "quote"

Story about report cards and eloping "it is with great regret ..."
    "Perspective is important in family life
    Perspective wrt to Paul's teaching in Roman times.

    Roman - patria protestus - father power - absolute authority life/slavery
    Paul's teaching was revolutionary for the times -- the 
    In our society we see the opposite - 
        revolutionary for different reason: fathers are portrayed as wimps / absentee

    The parent / child relationship is sacred

    The first mention of love in a relationship is between a father and son
    Gen 22:2 Abraham's son Isaac who he loves, offered as sacrifice - father / son
    picture of God the Father and Son


    This is a template for father and son in the family context
        God is an example to fathers
        Jesus is an example to children

Key:
    Just as our new identity in Christ reflects the image of God
    Our relationship reflects God's nature

God's design for family => mutual submission per Eph 5
    same in marriage as in parent and child

    instructions and expectations are given in this passage
    and the øparallel passage Eph 6:1-4

1. God's instructions for children: "children obey your parents in everything
    for this pleases the Lord."

    This letter is being read in the church to the Colossians with expectation
    that children will hear what's being read.


    the word Child assumes - still under parents roof, responsibility and
    therefore they must obey their parents
    
    The idea of honoring your parents extends to adult children - we are all
    someone's child

    The word "OBEY" : listen to a command, be obedient, used of the duty of a
    porter to answer the door to find out who it is.
    SO connection between hearing and doing.

>>> like a football huddle 39:00
    obey -> Eph _____ " ... in the Lord ... "
    Acts 17:26 all nations from Abraham
        God's fingerprint is on our lives
        and its no accident what parents we have

Do what you parents ask -> is the best thing not to rebel
Prov 3:17 rebellion results in this.

2 Tim 3:1-2 ... disobedient to parents
Lk 2:51 Jesus submitted to his earthly parents

Prov 10:1 Bless Parents
Eph 6:1 children obey
    honor your father and mother - 1st commandment with a promise
    honor == respect/value

Learn God's purpose for my life -> obey God, honor your parents

Phil 2:14 and do it w/o grumbling

Question: what is God challenging us with?
