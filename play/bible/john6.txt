v22 - 25: following Jesus, where did he go?  no boats were seen :)
when did you come - Jesus always answers the real issue, not surface

They are seeking bread:
1. Physical  - v22-29
2. Spiritual - v30-40
3. Mystical  - v41-59


Physical bread:
v27-29: in the midst of our physical work, our motive s/b external values
  -> what work(s)? -> the work [believe in Jesus]
    -> Rev 2:5 do the first work - return (very simple)


Spiritual bread:
v30-40: Manna? Ps 78:23-28
    Moses' manna was not from heaven, it was physical manna - Jesus is the 
        true manna from heaven
    v39: "... that I should lose nothing..." -> Jn 6:12 "Gather...that nothing be lost


Mystical bread:
v41-59: 
    v44: election vs predestination? say "I believe ..." and be done!
    eating:
        v51:    phagion - single act, salvation
        v54...: trogon  - continual eating, communion, our sustanance.
            1 Cor 11:23-34 communion -> we give worth to the act of communion,
                not that we are worthy

3 responses to mysical bread:
1. unbelief - 60-66 
2. belief   - 66-69 v68 where will we go?
3. apostate - 70-71 


Takeaways:
1. Jesus is the Bread, our basic diet for sustenance.
2. How do we stir up our appetites? (Matt 5:6)
