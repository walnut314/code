Saving Faith vs Superficial faith
Jn 4:46-54
v46: So he came again to Cana in Galilee, here he had made the water wine.  And at Caper-
naum there was an official whose son was ill.

    Capernaum a fishing village w/disciples

v47: When this man heard the Jesus had come from Judea to Gelilee, he went to him and asked
him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.

    officer in royal service of Herod Antipas - beheaded John the Baptist
        -> was powerless and desparate.

v48: So Jesus said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe".

    mild rebuke or teaching moment? -- "greater things you will do"
    the Judeans believed Jesus to be a miracle worker - a superficial faith

v49: The official said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies".

    sir and child (not son) - we also call our adult sons and daughters, our children
    addresses Jesus as sir - his superior
    pleaded, persistent, tenacity
    what moves us to desparation, when it comes to our kids, we are tenacious

v50: Jesus said to him, "Go your son will live". The man believed the word that Jesus spoke
to him and went on his way.

   believed the word (without seeing) that Jesus spoke - the miracle

v51: As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was recovering.

    recovering not recovered

v52: So he asked them the hour when he began to get better, and they said to him, "Yesterday
at the seventh hour the fever left him".

    number 7 - Samaritan woman had 7 husbands: 6 + Jesus

v53: The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live."  And
he himself believed, and all his household.

    again, a gentile is saved.
    He himself - emphatic - believed in His person
    the household shared in saving faith - salvation

v54: This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.
